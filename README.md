# Kirchhayn Autoparts

This website is a project I completed for Kirchhayn Autoparts during my tenure at iNET. I took on the challenge of developing this site from the ground up using ASP .NET, showcasing my proficiency in server-side web development.

Currently, I am actively engaged in a refactoring effort aimed at enhancing the website's user experience and performance. This refactoring involves the incorporation of modern React concepts and a component-based architecture, aligning the project with current web development trends and best practices.

By combining my initial work in ASP .NET with my ongoing efforts to integrate React, I aim to create a dynamic and responsive web solution that delivers an exceptional user experience for Kirchhayn Autoparts and their customers. Stay tuned to see how this project evolves and improves with these enhancements.
