# Project Name: Kirchhayn Autoparts

## Project Description:
This project is a fully responsive static website I worked on during my tenure at iNET Web in Waukesha Wisconsin. It was for a small autoparts/wrecking yard in Fredonia Wisconsin. Developed using HTML and SCSS from scratch, this project highlights my ability to turn a design into frontend code with attention to detail.
